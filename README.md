# template-config-templates
Templates to start from when creating configuration files for Platform.sh templates. Includes ALL top-level properties
that are possible, comments describing the property, and a link to the docs for more information on the property. 

**REMOVE PROPERTIES AND COMMENTS THAT ARE NOT USED IN THE TEMPLATE YOU ARE CREATING**

Samples have been encluded and can be identified by being enclosed by `<` and `>` 
(e.g. `<app-name>`). These **MUST** be replaced.

Properties that do not contain a value (e.g. `size:`) **MUST** be completed or removed.
