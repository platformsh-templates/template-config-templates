# template-config-templates
Configuration templates to start from when creating configuration files for official Platform.sh templates. Includes ALL top-level properties
that are possible, comments describing the property, and a link to the docs for more information on the property. 

## Description
* Top-level properties should be in the same order as [listed in the docs](https://docs.platform.sh/create-apps/app-reference.html#top-level-properties). Not all properties are needed by all templates, so only needed ones should be included, but their order in the config file should match the order as weâ€™ve provided in the docs.   
**REMOVE PROPERTIES AND COMMENTS THAT ARE NOT USED IN THE TEMPLATE YOU ARE CREATING**
* Configuration files should maintain consistent formatting. Spaces are required. A `.editorconfig` file has been included to set the format.
*  All calls to bash scripts should not assume the script file is executable and should instead explicitly pass the file the bash binary.
*  Exceptions should be documented in the config file.
*  Samples have been encluded and can be identified by being enclosed by `<` and `>` (e.g. `<app-name>`). These **MUST** be replaced.
*  Properties that do not contain a value (e.g. `size:`) **MUST** be completed or removed.
